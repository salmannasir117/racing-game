Start scene file: GameStartScene

How to play the game:
    - Click "Start" to start the game from the beginning or "Select Level" to start from a specific level. 
    - WASD for movement of player
    - Move the player from checkpoint to checkpoint using the path as guidance.
    - Do NOT skip any checkpoints or you will not be able to progress to the next level.
    - collect the cute cats at your own peril...
        - (they serve no function other than to be cute and distract the player)
    
    - Click "esc" to open the pause menu
        - You can then restart the level, exit the game, or return to the main menu

    - The game is over once you complete all three levels.

To observe the AI: 
    - One implementation is the cats on the beach and forest map. They are in an idle state until a player gets close enough to them. They will then follow the player.
    - There is an AI storm cloud on the volcano map that has a set patrol and a state in which it targets the player. It adds to the ambiance of the map.

Known problem areas: 
    - No known problem areas.
